### Abstract ###
We present a system to achieve joint registration and fusion
of RGB and Infrared (IR) videos. While RGB is related to human perception, IR is related to the heat. However, IR images
often lack good contour and texture information. An increasing number of researchers work on fusing visible and IR images
to obtain more information from them, which requires two completely matched images. However, classical methods assuming
ideal imaging conditions fail to achieve satisfactory performance
in real cases. From the data-dependent modeling point of view,
labeling the dataset is costly and impractical.
In this context, we present a framework that tackles two
challenging tasks. First, a video registration procedure aims to
align IR and RGB videos. Second, a fusion method brings all
the essential information from the two video modalities to a single video. We evaluate our approach on a challenging dataset of
RGB and IR video pairs collected for firefighters to do their missions more efficiently due to the difficulties in the vision, such as
environments with heavy smoke after a fire
